# v1.1.0-rc.1 - Test Release Candidate

This is a test release to validate the automated release workflow, changelog injection, and version syncing into the executable metadata.

## 🔧 What We're Verifying
- Release notes are automatically pulled from `docs/changelog/v1.1.0-rc.1.md`
- Workflow correctly sets Cargo.toml version to `1.1.0-rc.1`
- Windows EXE metadata (ProductVersion/FileVersion string) reflects `1.1.0-rc.1`
- Release assets are packaged and uploaded correctly

## ✨ Highlights (carry-over)
- Multi-monitor capture using `MonitorFromPoint`
- Custom system tray icon loaded from `icon.ico`
- Real-time settings display in overlay
- Improved ESC behavior: stop capture before exit

If you see this content in the GitHub Release body for `v1.1.0-rc.1`, the changelog injection works.
