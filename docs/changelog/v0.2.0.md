# v0.2.0 - December 28, 2025

## 🎉 New Features

### Multi-Monitor Support (#3)
- **Capture works on any monitor**, not just the primary display
- Automatic monitor detection based on overlay window position
- Uses `MonitorFromPoint` API for accurate monitor selection
- Seamless experience across all connected displays

### Custom System Tray Icon (#2)
- System tray now displays the **RustFrame application icon** instead of a generic blue square
- Icon loaded from `icon.ico` file at runtime
- Fallback to default icon if file not found
- Supports loading from both executable directory and current directory

### Improved ESC Key Behavior (#5)
- **ESC in capture mode**: Stops capture and returns to selection mode (instead of closing app)
- **ESC in selection mode**: Exits the application
- More intuitive user experience - prevents accidental app closure

### Real-Time Settings Display (#9)
- **Settings status visible in overlay** during selection mode
- Color-coded indicators:
  - 🟢 Green = Enabled
  - 🔴 Red = Disabled
- Updates instantly when toggling settings with keyboard shortcuts (C, B, E)
- Visual feedback for: Cursor visibility, Border visibility, Exclude from capture mode
